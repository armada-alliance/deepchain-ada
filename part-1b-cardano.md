# Part 1b: Cardano

We have completed the Part1a which focussed on Distributed systems, challenges and how it relates to blockchains. We then focused on Cryptographic principles, wallets and transactions. These are the founding principles of blockchain

In Part1b we will focus mainly on Cardano. We start with

1\) Consensus protocols: Ouroboros Classic, Praos, Genesis, Chronos&#x20;

2\) Networking and mini protocols

3\) EUTXO in detail

4\) Plutus framework : Onchain and offchain

In parallel we will have basic Haskell completed so that after Part1b we can focus on writing Plutus applications

Part2 will focus on Machine Learning fundamentals which will start once we finish Plutus framework.
